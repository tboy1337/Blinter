# Blinter Architecture

Blinter is a read-only static analyzer for Windows batch files (`.bat`, `.cmd`). It does not execute batch code; it parses source text and applies rule checkers.

```

1. **Input** — `read_file_with_encoding` reads the batch file; encoding is detected via `charset_normalizer` with fallbacks.
2. **Structure** — Labels, SET variables, delayed expansion, and embedded script blocks are analyzed.
3. **Checkers** — Line and global rules run via `orchestration._process_file_checks`.
4. **Filter** — `BlinterConfig`, inline `REM LINT:IGNORE` comments, and severity filters apply.
5. **Output** — `LintIssue` list returned to library callers, or formatted by the CLI as human-readable text (`output/formatters.py`) or structured JSON (`output/json_formatter.py` via `--format json` / `--output`).

## Public vs internal imports

**Supported public API** (import from `blinter`):

- `lint_batch_file`, `read_file_with_encoding`, `find_batch_files`
- `load_config`, `create_default_config_file`, `main`
- `BlinterConfig`, `LintIssue`, `Rule`, `RuleSeverity`
- `__version__`, `__author__`, `__license__` — `__version__` is read from `[project].version` in `pyproject.toml` when developing from a source checkout; otherwise it uses installed package metadata (`importlib.metadata`), with a final fallback to parsing `pyproject.toml` (see `_version.py`).

**Internal / extension imports** (import from subpackages):

```python
from blinter.rules.registry import RULES
from blinter.checkers.syntax import _check_syntax_errors
from blinter.checkers.advanced import _check_advanced_escaping_rules
from blinter.checkers.globals import _check_unreachable_code
```

Only symbols listed in `blinter.__all__` are stable for external integrators. Checker facades (`blinter.checkers.advanced`, `blinter.checkers.globals`) re-export symbols for tests and advanced use; keep their `__all__` lists in sync when moving functions between submodules.

## Checker refactor (advanced / globals)

Former monolithic modules were split into subpackages with facade `__init__.py` files that re-export all symbols. `orchestration.py` imports from the facades, so call sites do not need deep paths like `blinter.checkers.globals.exit_flow`.

When adding or moving a checker function:

1. Place it in the appropriate submodule under `advanced/` or `globals/`.
2. Add the symbol to that subpackage's `__init__.py` and `__all__`.
3. If `orchestration.py` calls it, ensure the facade export exists.

## Thread safety

`lint_batch_file` and `read_file_with_encoding` are designed for concurrent use: they use local state and immutable global rule metadata. The CLI runs single-threaded. `RULES` is read-only at runtime.

Per-lint invocation-prefix data (subroutine reachability for rules such as SEC014) is stored in a `contextvars.ContextVar` cache that is reset at the start of each `lint_batch_file` call, so concurrent lints in different threads do not share or clear each other's prefix state. Shared `lines_cache` reads and writes are synchronized via a lock in `engine/lines_cache.py`.

## `--follow-calls` and `scan_root`

When `follow_calls` is enabled, Blinter resolves `CALL` targets to read variables and lint called scripts recursively. Variable context is position-aware (available only after each `CALL` line) and includes variables from transitively called scripts within `MAX_FOLLOW_CALL_DEPTH` and `MAX_FOLLOW_CALL_FILES`. The CLI sets `BlinterConfig.scan_root` to the target directory (or the parent of a single file) so paths outside the scan root are not read or processed. `lint_batch_file()` defaults `scan_root` to the batch file's parent directory when unset, matching CLI containment for library callers. Follow-call lint failures on callee scripts are best-effort (logged, no exit impact); skipped primary discovery targets exit with code 1.

## Configuration

`BlinterConfig` controls recursion, rule enablement, `max_line_length`, `follow_calls`, `scan_root`, and severity filtering. Values can be loaded from `blinter.ini` and overridden by CLI flags.

## SSOT split: batch-spec vs Blinter

| Artifact | Repo / path |
|----------|-------------|
| ANTLR grammar, expansion rules, command catalog, cmd-help | [`vendor/batch-spec`](../vendor/batch-spec) ([`tboy1337/batch-spec`](https://github.com/tboy1337/batch-spec), pinned in [`spec/batch-spec.lock`](../spec/batch-spec.lock)) |
| [`spec/data/rules.yaml`](../spec/data/rules.yaml) | Rule catalog (`checker: regex`; see `RULE_COUNT`) |
| [`spec/data/commands-linter.yaml`](../spec/data/commands-linter.yaml) | Security/style command policy (merged with batch-spec `commands.yaml` for `patterns.py`; pins W009 `older_windows_commands`) |
| [`spec/corpus/`](../spec/corpus/) | 203 committed fixtures + `expect.json` oracles |
| [`spec/audit/`](../spec/audit/) | Reference matrix and audit baselines |

Clone with `git clone --recurse-submodules` or run `git submodule update --init --recursive` after checkout.

Generators live under [`scripts/spec/`](../scripts/spec/). `scripts/verify.py` runs schema validation, generator `--check`, strict SSOT audit, cmd.exe oracle (Windows), linting, and tests.

`patterns.py` `BUILTIN_COMMANDS` is generated as the union of batch-spec `builtin_commands` and
`common_external_tools` so stock Windows utilities and common dev tools both suppress E012/E014.
Deprecated/removed command tables come from batch-spec `commands.yaml` unchanged.

**cmd.exe oracle:** [`scripts/spec/cmd_oracle.py`](../scripts/spec/cmd_oracle.py) runs safe corpus fixtures in isolated `cmd /c` subprocesses. Destructive, interactive, or long-running fixtures remain static-only; skips are listed in [`oracle-skip.yaml`](../spec/corpus/meta/oracle-skip.yaml).

Corpus policy: every rule in `rules.yaml` must have at least one corpus assertion (see `audit_ssot.py` coverage checks).

**Performance gate:** [`scripts/benchmark_lint.py`](../scripts/benchmark_lint.py) with `--check-baseline` compares the synthetic-file median against [`spec/benchmark/synthetic-baseline.json`](../spec/benchmark/synthetic-baseline.json). Local A/B timing uses [`scripts/experiment_benchmark.py`](../scripts/experiment_benchmark.py).
