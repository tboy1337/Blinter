# Contributing to Blinter

Thank you for helping improve Blinter. This document explains how to report issues, propose changes, and meet the project's quality expectations.

## Ways to Contribute

- Report bugs or false positives via [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/tboy1337/Blinter/issues)
- Suggest new rules or features via [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/tboy1337/Blinter/issues)
- Submit pull requests with bug fixes, new rules, tests, or documentation
- Improve docs under `docs/` or the `README.md`

## Bug Reports

When filing a bug report, include:

- Blinter version (`blinter --version` or `python -m blinter --version`)
- Python version and OS
- Minimal `.bat` or `.cmd` sample that reproduces the issue
- Expected vs. actual behavior

Security issues must **not** be filed as public issues. See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

## Pull Request Process

1. Fork the repository and create a branch from `main`.
2. Clone with submodules: `git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/tboy1337/Blinter.git`
3. Install development dependencies: `pip install -e ".[dev]"`
4. Make your changes and add or update tests where appropriate.
5. Run the full local quality gate: `py scripts/verify.py`
6. Open a pull request against `main` with a clear description of the change and how you tested it.

Maintainers review PRs on GitHub. Address review feedback with additional commits on the same branch.

## Coding Standards

Match the existing codebase style:

| Tool | Purpose |
| ---- | ------- |
| [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/) | Python formatting (`line-length = 88`) |
| [isort](https://pychecks.com/isort/) | Import sorting (Black-compatible profile) |
| [mypy](https://mypy-lang.org/) | Static type checking (`strict` mode) |
| [pylint](https://pylint.readthedocs.io/) | Linting (`pylintrc`) |
| [bandit](https://bandit.readthedocs.io/) | Security linting for Python |
| [PSScriptAnalyzer](https://github.com/PowerShell/PSScriptAnalyzer) | PowerShell scripts in `scripts/` |

Auto-fix formatting before committing:

```bash
py scripts/verify.py --fix
```

## Testing Policy

**Major new functionality must include automated tests.**

- Add or extend tests under `tests/` using [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/).
- Rule changes should include corpus fixtures under `spec/corpus/` when applicable.
- Run `py -m pytest` locally; CI runs the suite on Ubuntu, macOS, and Windows across Python 3.11–3.14.
- Optional corpus regression tests require a local `batch-script-examples/` directory (see `README.md`).

CI also runs static analysis, formatting checks, and `pip-audit` on every push and pull request to `main` (see `.github/workflows/CI.yml`).

## Rule and Spec Changes

Lint rules are defined in the SSOT under `spec/`. When adding or changing rules:

1. Update `spec/data/rules.yaml` and related generated artifacts as needed.
2. Run `py scripts/spec/validate_spec.py` and the `generate_* --check` scripts (or `py scripts/verify.py`).
3. Add corpus cases under `spec/corpus/` with `input.cmd` and `expect.json`.

See [docs/Architecture.md](docs/Architecture.md) for module layout and extension points.

## Commit Messages

Write clear, imperative commit messages (e.g., "Add W064 rule for X", "Fix false positive in E019"). Version bumps in `pyproject.toml` are handled separately for releases.
